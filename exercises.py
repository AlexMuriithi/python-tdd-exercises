It was bought during the First World War in a little general store in

the day he set sail for Paris. It was your great-granddaddy's war watch,
made by the first company
to ever make wrist watches. You see, up until then, people just carried pocket
watches. Your great-granddaddy wore that watch every day he was in the war.
Then when he had done his duty, he went home to your great- grandmother, took
the watch off his wrist and put it in an ol' coffee can. And in that can it
stayed 'til your grandfather Dane Coolidge was called upon by his country to go
overseas and fight the Germans once again. This time they called it World War
Two. Your great-granddaddy gave it to your granddad for good luck.
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's. Your granddad was a
Marine and he was killed with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake
Island. Your granddad was facing death and he knew it. None of those boys had
any illusions about ever leavin' that island alive. So three days before the
Japanese took the island, your 22-year old grandfather asked a gunner on an Air
Force transport named Winocki, a man he had never met before in his life, to
deliver to his infant son, who he had never seen in the flesh, his gold watch.
Three days later, your grandfather was dead. But Winocki kept his word. After
the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your
infant father, his Dad's gold watch. This watch. This watch was on your Daddy's
wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi. He was captured and put in a Vietnamese
prison camp. Now he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd be confiscated.
The way your Daddy looked at it, that watch was your birthright. And he'd be
damned if and slopeheads were gonna put their greasy yella hands on his boy's
birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide somethin'. His
ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of
dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk of metal up my
ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And
now, little man, I give the watch to you."""
